I am a process engineer working in the field of biorefinery process development. I have completed my PhD from Masdar Institute, Abu Dhabi. The PhD program at Masdar Institute and my PhD research
project were in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I got the opportunity to do
research at both the institutes with a multidisciplinary team.

In summary, my research experience is in modeling, optimization, and process design of chemical and bioprocesses. I consider myself privileged to have experienced the strengths and limitations of both the experimental and modeling domains, and I understand their synergy that is required for successful development
of any new chemical process. 

I write this blog to share my personal notes on process engineering, use of open source programming tools in process engineering, and data science.
